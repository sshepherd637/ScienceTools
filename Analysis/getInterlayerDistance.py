"""
    Script created to compute the interlayer distance between a two layer system.
    The interlayer distance at any time T is dependant on the interlayer interactions between
    the two layers. By computing this interlayer distance (Simply the Z component) we can gather 
    a comparative measure of the mobility of the clay layers, i.e. weaker interlayer interactions
    would allow for larger fluctuations in the interlayer distance and vice-versa.
